# Le Plan

(This is highly subject to change)

**Currently at stage 1**

## Stage 1
- [ ] Reconstruct the core framework of BWG ([see here](https://github.com/GutterCat42/blobs-with-guns-archive))
  - Make the code elegant so that it is easy to add to and readable by normal humans
  - Do it all using Git and Github from the beginning
  - Do it in [Godot 4](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)
- [ ] Document everything in Github Wikis to make it easy for other contributors (and also just because I like documentation)

## Stage 2
- [ ] Fix the remaining bugs
- [ ] Finish adding features that were not fully implemented in the original BWG
- [ ] Add the most important new features and properly balance the game

## Stage 3
- Expand the game and see where things end up! This is pretty far away, so we can make up more of a plan when we get here as to where we want to steer the project.

## Backlog
- [ ] Adjustable splash screen size
- [ ] Icons

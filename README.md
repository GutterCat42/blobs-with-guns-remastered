# Blobs with Guns: Remastered

[Blobs with Guns](https://github.com/GutterCat42/blobs-with-guns-archive) is a game I made once in Godot 3. It was a cool idea and a horrible execution because my code was disgusting. This led to many performance issues and bugs, not to mention the fact that it was pure torture trying to add to my horrible code.

Anyway, so this time we're doing it again, but better.

**This project is currently in its earliest stages and I will update this README (and everything else) once I work out what I'm doing :)**
(Including some information on what the game is actually about)

### I am currently using [Godot 4.1.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.1.1-stable) to develop this game

## Le plan
(This is highly subject to change)

**Currently at stage 1**

1. Reconstruct the core framework of BWG
2. Do it all using Git and Github from the beginning
3. Do it in [Godot 4](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)
4. Document everything in Github Wikis to make it easy for other contributors (and also just because I like documentation)
5. Make the code elegant so that it is easy to add to and readable by normal humans
6. Fix the remaining bugs
7. Finish adding features that were not fully implemented in the original BWG
8. Add the most important features and properly balance the game
9. Expand the game and see where things end up! This is pretty far away, so we can make up more of a plan when we get here as to where we want to steer the project.
